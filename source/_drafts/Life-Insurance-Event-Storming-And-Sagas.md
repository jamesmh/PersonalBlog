title: Re-designing A Life Insurance Selling Platform Using Event Storming And Sagas
tags: domain-driven design, event storming

Years ago, I lead the web development of a new platform for selling life insurance online (which provided white-label abilities).

This was one of my biggest professional accomplishments given the many technical and political constraints. But that's a whole other topic for another day.

This was before I understood domain-driven design. Since then, I've wondered: what this might have looked like using a domain-driven approach?

Here are a few points we'll cover:

- Event storming: what it is and how to model an existing system or business domain
- How thinking of a system in terms of domain events can _really_ help clarify things
- Some important problems that life insurance businesses might face
- How to tackle interactions with external systems/APIs better
- How certain distributed patterns can improve the UX of a system

# What Is Event Storming?

Event storming is a workshop that is usually held to discover and learn about how a business works. You invite all relevant stakeholders and use sticky notes to discover what domain events occur, and what impact or additional processes they might lead to.

I've also found event storming to be helpful even in smaller settings and within smaller team discussions or design discussions.

For more, see [the book by its creator on leanpub](https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming).

In this article, I'll be using a simple and minimal version of event storming so we can focus on the important stuff.

# Past Design

This system was designed for 3rd party insurance providers to allow their customers to apply for life insurance through it. That means the _entire_ application or, for some providers, _only certain parts_ of the application.

Generally speaking, the process went like this:

1. Accept some HTTP POST data from an initial form filled out by a third-party provider.

2. The user continues to fill out the online life insurance application (with multiple steps).

   1. First, general contact information.
   2. Next, information about beneficiaries, etc.
   3. Then, a medical questionnaire.
   4. Etc.

3. Once done, the user would provide their banking information.

4. It would then process the application by calling a remote API (synchronously - while the user waited for the UI to refresh).

5. Finally, it would display whether the application was accepted or not (with the next steps for the user to take).

Everything was done in one massive code-base. All the web UI and business logic were all together.

Some of the problems with this approach were:

- Lack of code quality
- Difficulty in terms of maintainability
- Lack of business processes documented in how the code was structured
- Long-running synchronous HTTP POSTs could time-out and cause processing errors
- And more...

# Exploring Our Domain

Let's look at the business flow in terms of the events that occur in the domain to give us an overview of what we're dealing with.

This is _not_ an exhaustive look at all the domain events: _just the important ones for now_:

![events](/img/insurance/events1.png)

`PersonalInformationProvided` is considered a domain event because other stuff happens in response.

For example, the insurance company insisted that the system send an e-mail with a token so the proposed insured (i.e. the applicant) could resume their application at a later date.

The results of `MedicalQuestionsProvided` may lead to the disqualification of the applicant, disqualification of the selected insurance product, enable an entirely different path throughout the rest of the form, etc. These would be domain events too, but they aren't shown for simplicity's sake.

## The Interesting Parts...

After the application is completed, we get into the next steps:

![events](/img/insurance/events2.png)

As you can see, this is where things get interesting.

Right after `BankingInfoProvided` the system would remotely call the insurance company's "special" API that would look at past applicant history, banking history, medical history, etc. and make a decision. This decision was returned via the same HTTP POST (ðŸ™ƒ).

In some cases, the proposed insured had to undergo a physical medical examination at a later date. Their application was kept in a pending state. 

If the application passed, then then the insurance policy would be created (`PolicyCreated`). Otherwise, a failure just meant there was no policy created and everyone could be on their merry way.

If the application was accepted (`ApplicationAccepted`), then the insurance policy would be created right away (`PolicyCreated`).

Upon the first payment of the policy (`FirstPolicyPaymentRecieved`), the policy would "activate." If a policy was not activated within the first 30 days (or some arbitrary duration), it would be immediately cancelled.   

# Bounded Contexts

In the design of the existing system, there was no concept of bounded contexts. Everything was stored in one massive XML file (yes...the things we have to deal with in outdated industries).

We know though that we need to split this up. How should we?

## Pivotal Events

One of the kinds of events to watch out for is what Alberto Brandolini (the creator of event storming) calls "pivotal events." These are the most important events because they seem to be drivers for major transitions within a domain.

In this scenario, the most important event is `PolicyCreated`. This is when the application has officially transitioned into a real insurance policy. **That's the end goal of what the user wants in the first place.**

Interestingly, this is also where the user-facing web application ended and the backend office policy management began.

## Sub-Domains

Another interesting area (that you might not be aware of unless you're familiar with the industry) is that the medical questionnaire can be _very_ complex. Depending on how you answer certain questions, many different things could happen. 

The code and business logic around this specific area is a hotspot. 

Because of the complexity contained within this area, I'd be interested in exploring this area as a sub-domain and treating it as a bounded context.

Definitely, from the business' perspective, the `MedicalQuestionsProvided` is also a pivotal event. It's the main driver for whether a proposed insured is eligible for coverage or qualifies for additional "bonus" insurance add-on products.

> In the existing system, this part of the system was the hardest to build and maintain!

This is where the main concept of bounded contexts shines (I think) - you can draw a bubble around a specific area or problem space that's complex and keep that complexity isolated. No one else needs to know _how_ it works. It just needs to know what happens at the end of the questionnaire.

## Transitions Between Sub-Domains

What you'll notice though, if we did that, is that the flow of data is from one context, into another, and then back out into the same one again.

![events](/img/insurance/events3.png)

Usually, in DDD examples, you see data flow from one context into another and the flow never returns to the original context again. 

My gut feeling is that these kinds of complex sub-domains that are smack in the middle of some over-arching business process or other parent domains are common in real-world domains.

# NaÃ¯ve API Calls Vs. Sagas 

One of the major issues with the existing system was that it would issue an HTTP POST directly from the web application to the insurance provider's "special" API that would approve or decline an application.

Again, this easily leads to issues like:

- HTTP timeouts due to network issues
- Errors when the endpoint was down
- The request just took too long and timed-out...

Since this was a white-label product, that API would not necessarily be controlled by the insurance provider who we were building this for. So, we had no control over the performance and availability of that API.

How would I do this today? 

To re-cap more clearly, here are the steps needed (barebones):

- Submit the application (via HTTP POST)
- Wait...
- Make sure to retry on errors...
- Abort if the external system never responds
- If it does respond, then give the results to the user

This type of long-running job/process is usually best done using the [saga pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html).

> Other considerations when dealing with these type of long-running jobs might be the [routing slip pattern](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/RoutingTable.html) or the [process manager pattern](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ProcessManager.html) - both of which are similar to the saga pattern but handy for different kinds of problems.

With the saga pattern, here's roughly what I would envision:

![saga](/img/insurance/saga1.png)

This looks a lot more complicated, but bear with me for a moment.

Notice that instead of just issuing the HTTP POST "plain-and-simple", the `BankingInfoProvided` event will kick-off a long-running background job. Specifically, the `ApplicationSubmissionSaga`.

This saga has two handlers:

1. The first will attempt to call the API and submit the application.
2. The second will receive an asynchronous event informing it of the submission status. 

Why? What does this give us?

## Building Resilient Systems

In the original design (direct HTTP POST) - what happens if the external API is **not even running?**

Oh...

I guess the user is out of luck. They can't submit their application...

What if this happens when using the saga pattern?

The saga would just go to "sleep" and re-try at a later date as a background process. If the external system comes back up the next day then the saga will succeed in submitting the application and continue! 

_Note: This re-try process is indicated in the diagram above by the orange gear on the `SubmitApplicationForApprovalStep`._

This way of dealing with a distributed transaction (even if the external API isn't owned by you) helps you to build systems that **can fail and are expected to fail well.**

## Implications For UX

Let's compare the two designs in terms of impact on UX. **Yes, this difference in modelling impacts UX in a huge way.**

With the naÃ¯ve original design, if the external system is down, **the user cannot complete his application.** So... the user will have to come back to the website at a later date and "try again!"

What about with the saga?

Here's where using this pattern shines: the user will "complete" his/her application and we will tell them, "You will receive an e-mail within the next 24 hours once we've finished processing your application."

The user goes home and eventually, at some point in the near future, will get an e-mail telling them everything they need to know.

_Note: In the diagram above, you'll see that I've added the commands around this part of the process._

So... what if the external system is down? 

_The user doesn't know_. They're gone. We've designed our system such that the user isn't needed for us to communicate with the external API and deal with failures. 

**What is the user's experience? Awesome.**

The implications of this are huge. This is the difference between systems that are easy to use and annoying and difficult to use.

**This can affect the branding and reputation of the insurance company.**

If users can't even complete their application because they need to have their web browser open so that our system can communicate with the insurance providers API... that's crazy. Really bad.

## The Importance Of Modelling Your Domain Well

This comes back to the idea of modelling your domain well. This is all modelling. We haven't written any code, but conceptually we can know what would happen with both designs.

This is why it's important for companies who want to succeed and give their users the best experience possible to hire developers and engineers who are good at modelling business domains and processes like this.

It literally could be the difference between a company's success and failure!

And it's one look at why learning to model with these tools is important as a developer/engineer.

Hopefully, this has sparked some interest and ideas in your mind about some of the systems you've helped to build in the past!
